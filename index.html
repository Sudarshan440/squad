   <h1> StormxBreaker</h1>
   <h2> aka <em> Sudarshan</em></h2>
   <p>clan master of <strong>wolves</strong></p>
<p>  
     I am good and skillful gamer. I love to play both mobile and pc games.
     I represent myself as The man of my word.
     I am enthusiast mostly for battle royale but enjoy multiplayer ranked as well with the same energy. 
     I love to play with my teamates as a squad and mostly we going to rush down enemies with our teamwork. 

     <p> My teamates <strong> VISION aka <em> Sneha </em></strong> is play the key role in game as well
         in a attacking and she is my jump leader also who always ready to roll with her beauty and fire 
         which is the best way to dominate me to support with extra hand of artillary in battle.
         sometimes i want to play safe and she wants to attack but then eventually i choose to attack and we win a match too.
         why not, she is totally good in fast thinking and ready to execute with headshot anyone she sees on foot.

     <p>The other member i like to introduce is <b>AHANKAAR aka <i>Aman</i></b>. The Unpredictable survivour and saviour and he can whacked anybody with his smooth submachine gun who shows ahnkar in front of him. 
     He is a good pilot may be in real who knows but for sure in battle royale where he can rumble down from the sky any smuk faces too if he gets angry.
     he is a funny guy and a funster even in hard times and we all support each other and share joy and zeal.</p></p></p>
